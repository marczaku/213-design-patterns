# YAGNI Principle

> You ain't gonna need it!

Designs and/or systems should be as simple as possible. Wherever possible, complexity should be avoided in a systemâ€”as simplicity guarantees the greatest levels of user acceptance and interaction.

It is a mantra from ExtremeProgramming that's often used generally in agile software teams. It's a statement that some capability we presume our software needs in the future should not be built now because "you aren't gonna need it".
