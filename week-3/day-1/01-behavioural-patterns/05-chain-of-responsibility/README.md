# Chain of Responsibility

What's that in real life?

## Summary

Passes the request along the chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

## Motivation

When decoupling, there will often be many classes that can handle the same type of event

## Example
- Android Back Button

## Use Cases
- Health-System (Armor, Shield)
- Input
- Traps in a Card Game
