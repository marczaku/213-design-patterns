# DRY Principle

> “Giving a computer two contradictory pieces of knowledge was Captain
James T. Kirk’s preferred way of disabling a marauding artificial
intelligence. Unfortunately, the same principle can be effective in
bringing down your code.”

The Pragmatic Programmer by Dave Thomas, Andy Hunt

## Stay DRY

`DRY - Don't repeat yourself`

> “The alternative is to have the same thing expressed in two or more
places. If you change one, you have to remember to change the
others, or, like the alien computers, your program will be brought to
its knees by a contradiction. It isn’t a question of whether you’ll
remember: it’s a question of when you’ll forget.”

The Pragmatic Programmer by Dave Thomas, Andy Hunt
