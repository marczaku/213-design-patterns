# ETC Principle

> “As far as we can tell, every design principle out there is a special
case of ETC.
> 
> Why is decoupling good? Because by isolating concerns we make each
> easier to change. ETC.
> 
> 
> Why is the single responsibility principle useful? Because a change in
> requirements is mirrored by a change in just one module. ETC.
> 
> Why is naming important? Because good names make code easier to read,
> and you have to read it to change it. ETC!”
