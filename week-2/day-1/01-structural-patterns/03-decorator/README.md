# Decorator

## Summary

a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other instances of the same class.

## Motivation
Change a class instance's behavior without having to change it in any way.

## Example
- Health & Armor

## Use Cases
- Proxies
- Loggers
- Caching
- Stat System*
- Modular Weapon System*

*Note that, while idealistically speaking, these are great use cases, practically speaking, the principle "Composition over Inheritance" makes us often stray away from using the Decorator Pattern
