# Architecture

> “For me, good design means that when I make a change, it’s as if the entire
> program was crafted in anticipation of it. I can solve a task with just a few
> choice function calls that slot in perfectly, leaving not the slightest ripple
> on the placid surface of the code.”

## Costs?

1. It takes effort to maintain a high quality standard
2. High abstraction can increase complexity

> “Tt takes you forever to trace through all of that scaffolding to find some real
> code that does something. When you need to make a change, sure, there’s probably
> an interface there to help, but good luck finding it.”
