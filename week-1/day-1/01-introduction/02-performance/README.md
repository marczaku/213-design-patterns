# Performance

Many good code design patterns rely on:
- virtual dispatch
- interfaces
- pointer lookups
- allocations

Which in turn have negative performance impacts.\
This must be considered especially in Game Engine Development.

## Good Architecture
- flexible code
- making few or no assumptions

## Performance Optimizations
- always built on assumptions
- reduce flexibility

## But: Development Performance
- also important
- often most important!
