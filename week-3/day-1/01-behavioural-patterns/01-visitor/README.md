# Visitor

## Summary

a `Visitable` object permits a `Visitor` to operate on a specific element of its structure.

This process allows the visited object to acquire new functionality from visitors without being directly
modified.

## Motivation

Allow new functions to be added without changing a class.

Problem: Breaks encapsulation

## Example
