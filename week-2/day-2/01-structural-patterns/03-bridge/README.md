# Bridge

## Summary

Separate abstraction from implementation so that the two can vary independently. In game development, it can be applied to decouple abstraction (e.g., high-level gameplay) from implementation details (e.g., rendering engine).

## Motivation
Don't depend on on implementation details.

## Example
- Bridge to Backend

## Use Cases
- Platform Independence
